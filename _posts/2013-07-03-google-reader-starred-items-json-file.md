As we all know Google Reader closed it's site and left me with a huge collection of starred articles pending to be moved somewhere else. My current preffered way to read is through Pocket (former Read it later). So I needed way to import google take out archive (json file) into pocket. [Found that solution](http://htnawsaj.tumblr.com/post/47092594142/importing-google-reader-exisitng-starred-articles-to), but unfortunately it didn't worked for me, so I adapted code in java, which worked ok. [You can find it here](http://pastebin.com/d4a0tkAe).
