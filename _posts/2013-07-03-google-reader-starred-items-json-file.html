As we all know Google Reader closed it's site and left me with a huge collection of starred articles pending to be moved somewhere else. My current preffered way to read is through Pocket (former Read it later). So I needed way to import google take out archive (json file) into pocket. <a href="http://htnawsaj.tumblr.com/post/47092594142/importing-google-reader-exisitng-starred-articles-to">Found that solution</a>, but unfortunately it didn't worked for me, so I adapted code in java, which worked ok. <a href="http://pastebin.com/d4a0tkAe">You can find it here.</a>
