<p></p> <p>It’s not every day that Industria(the company I work for)&nbsp;is mentioned along with household names such as Adidas, BSkyB, BMW, Rolls Royce, Royal Bank of Scotland, Skype, Vodafone and Virgin Atlantic. <p>However, that’s just where we are in the March edition of global monthly <a href="http://cnbceb.com/2007/02/15/the-innovation-issue/">CNBC European Business</a>, which has named us as one of this year’s <b>50 key innovators</b> among European companies. <p>Described by the panel of judges as being “<b>potentially one of the biggest contributors to a European future of digital convergence and IPTV</b>“, Industria joins some of the world’s best-known companies on the list, which was compiled by a variety of experts on each of the ten sectors looked at. <p>According to the magazine, “<b>Industria’s ambition can be seen in its office locations: the UK, Ireland, Bulgaria and China. This Icelandic tiger specialises in software for bridging mobile and fixed-line networks, and its IPTV services platform subsidiary Zignal is creating a real stir</b>.”</p>
