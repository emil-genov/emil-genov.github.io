As a big fan of [David Allen's Getting Things Done book](http://gettingthingsdone.com/) I try to apply it's principles in organizing my personal life and tasks. I also really like using Google functionality, it's available everywhere, has great support in android and is backed up.

So I devised a system using two of Google tools: Keep, Calendar and Drive. It is based on very simple set of rules:

1. Every time a thought comes to my mind, of like "I should ..." or "I must ..." or "It will be good to ..." I create a new note in keep and mark it as #inbox
1. Once weekly I have a review of all notes tagged with **#inbox** and perform following for each note:
	1. If note is rubbish / don't want to do it -> I just delete it
	1. If I think is a good idea, but I do not want to do it right now I move it out of **#inbox** and into **#someday**
	1. If it gonna take less than 2 minutes I just do it and I archieve it
	1. If it's linked to some time frame, I create Google Calendar reminder for it, and move it out of **#inbox** and into **#waiting**
	1. If it takes single step I remove it from **#inbox** and pin it. Now it's in my pinned list of things I'm gonna do whenever I have free time and desire to do stuff.
	1. If it's a multistep process, I outline steps needed for achieving outcome (I usually put the outcome as a title of the note) and put a check box list of separate steps. Then I pin it. The first checkbox will behave as a task in pinned to-do list.
	1. If it's more like a project (a list of separate tasks, not so much connected between themselves) I create a main project card and mark it with **#project** and also mark it with specific project tag like **#!name-of-the-project**. I use the same tag to mark all other notes that belong to the project. I put the first task in pinned list, and all other in **@waiting**. That way when I finish a task associated with project I can go to project label and see which next task I want to do and move it from **@waiting** to pinned list.
1. On my android phone I use Google Keep widget to show me a list of my pinned tasks, which is my to-do list
1. Sometimes doing task creates usefull documentation, which I keep in Google Drive as a text document, which I can search for every time I need
1. When task is done I just archieve it in Google Keep.
1. Once every three months I have a medium term goals review. I ask myself following questions:
	1. Is there anything in **#someday** list that I might want to do?
	1. Is there any of my goals I'm not taking care of?
	1. Is the system in general working?

This is just a schema for storing data using Google tools. For the ideology and practicallities of GTD system (the benefits of it, removing of anxiety and better productivity) there is a ton of information on internet and in the David Allen's book itself.

I'll be glad if I've helped sombody.
